# Sales-Predictor
MarketCast AI was an AI-based forecasting solution developed to address inventory and sales management challenges in fast-paced supermarket environments. The system used past sales data to predict product demand on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, helping retailers optimize their stock flow.

The model utilized historical trends and regression-based forecasting techniques to identify buying patterns and sales peaks. By training on large datasets and refining features, the predictor accurately forecasted stock movement and recommended replenishment strategies.

The implementation led to a 60% improvement in inventory planning efficiency, significantly reducing both overstock and out-of-stock incidents. MarketCast AI is a prime example of how predictive analytics and intelligent algorithms can transform retail operations when paired with practical deployment logic.
